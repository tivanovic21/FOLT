# FOLT - Food and Beverage delivery app

## About
FOLT was created as a part of University project for a course in advanced web technologies and systems, it is written in Java and utilizes distributet systems and container orchestration for its workflow.
Main idea of the app is to simulate the functionalities of modern food delivery applications such as WOLT, Glovo, Uber Eats, etc. 

FOLT was developed with scalability in mind. It has support for multi threaded workflows, it allows multiple client processes to order at once and its main functionality is allowing those clients to 
view menus and place orders just like they would in the before mentioned applications.

This repository contains the whole "history" of the development process, going from the beginning phase in tivanovic21_vjezba_01 to the finished product in tivanovic21_vjezba_08_dz_3. Each version is built on top of the previos one.
